**Overview of the Analysis**

This analysis examined the temperatures in the months of June and December to determine if Surf and Ice Cream Shop would be able to sustain its business year-round. 
Using Python, Pandas functions, and SQLAlchemy, I filtered data in the Hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures collected for June and December. Once the data was collected, I converted them into a temperature list, created a DataFrame from the list, and generated a summary statistic. 



**Result**

Statistical Summary for Temperatures in the month of June

Analysis of Data 

•	According to the data, June, and December experience an average temperature of about 70 degrees, with June being a few degrees warmer than December.

•	Additionally, both June and December recorded highs in the mid to low 80s with the month of June being slightly warmer than December. 

•	There is however an 8-degree difference in the minimum temperatures. A low temperature of 56 degrees was recorded in Decemberd while a low of 64 degress was recorded in June. 



**Summary** 

Summary 
Based on the data provided, I believe an Ice Cream and Surf shop in Hawaii could sustain itself year-round. It is hard to imagine how a temperature of around 70 degrees would affect the sales of ice cream. I would however, collect more data on the low temperatures in December so that they do not fall below 50' too often. Perhaps data can be collected as far back as three or four years. Assuming the average low temperature for December is around 50 degrees, adding hot cocoa to the menu would be a good alternative to ice-cream, and allowing surfers to purchase protective clothing to keep them warm in the frigid waters would be a good idea. Apart from that, I think W. Avy should continue with the business plan.
